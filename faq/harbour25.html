  <h2><a name="25"></a>3.5. What is CVS and how do I use it?<a name="WhatIsCVS"></a></h2>
<p>Before proceeding you should probably have a good read of the <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/blandy.html">introduction to CVS by Jim Blandy</a>. Reading this document should save you a lot of confusion later
on.</p>
<p>To use the CVS server you first need to get a copy of the CVS client
software for your operating system:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Windows
<p>See <a href="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/windows.html">http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/windows.html</a> for more details.</p>


</li>
<li>DOS 16bit/32bit
<p>See the DOS section at <a href="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/other.html">http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/other.html</a>.</p>

</li>
<li>GNU/Linux
<p>Many GNU/Linux distributions come with the cvs client packaged as part of
the distribution. If you don't have it installed check your install CDs or
check the ftp site for the distribution in question.</p>


</li>
<li>OS/2
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/os2.html">http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/os2.html</a></li>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu/devtools/cvs110.zip">ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu/devtools/cvs110.zip</a></li>
</ul>



</li>
<li>Macintosh
<p>See <a href="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/mac.html">http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/mac.html</a> for more details.</p>


</li>
<li>Other
<p>If you are building Harbour with an operating system not listed then please
contact the FAQ maintainer with full details so that this list can be
updated.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Once you have got your CVS client installed you can gain anonymous access to
the Harbour CVS server. Depending on platform, the first thing you need to
do is set the <code>CVSROOT</code> environment variable to:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/harbour-project
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
</p>
<p>In addition to the above some environments might require extra information.
For example, the DOS, Windows and OS/2 CVS clients need to be given two
extra environment variables, <code>HOMEDRIVE</code> and <code>HOMEPATH</code>. These two
environment variables tell the CVS client where the source will live
locally. For example, if your Harbour development directory is at
S:\FREESOFT\HARBOUR you'd set:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
SET HOMEDRIVE=S
SET HOMEPATH=\FREESOFT\HARBOUR\
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
</p>
<p>Users of the Windows client have reported that the <code>HOMEPATH</code> environment
variable must start with and finish with a directory separator. Users of the
DOS client have reported that the <code>HOMEDRIVE</code> environment variable must
end with a colon.</p>
<p>Ensure that your harbour directory is created and change into it. Then run:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
cvs login
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
</p>
<p>and press enter when prompted for a password. Now run:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
cvs extract -P harbour
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
</p>
<p>to get a copy of the Harbour CVS repository (users of the DOS client have
reported that it doesn't have the <code>extract</code> command and that the
<code>checkout</code> command should be used instead, I'm also told that the cvs
client on GNU/Linux requires that you use <code>checkout</code>).</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: The CVS commands and directories are case sensitive: <code>harbour</code>
must be in all lower case (also note that on <a href="https://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a> Harbour is known as
"harbour-project").</p>
<p>Later, when you want to get changes from the CVS, you can do one of two
things:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat the <code>extract</code> command from your Harbour directory.</li>
<li>From your Harbour directory run '<code>cvs update</code>'.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If you have problems after reading the above please consider reading the
<a href="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/blandy.html">CVS introduction</a> and also the documentation for the CVS client you've
installed. If, after reading both those documents, you are still having
problems you should drop a polite message into the
<a href="harbour35.html#DevMailList">developer's mailing list</a> detailing your platform, environment, all
the steps you performed and the exact nature of the problem.</p>
