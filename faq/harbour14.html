<p>No, Harbour isn't in the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html">public domain</a>. Most parts of Harbour are copyrighted works and you
should respect those copyrights as you would any other copyright. With a
small number of exceptions each of the
<a href="harbour9.html#WhoDevelopers">Harbour authors</a> have placed their code under Harbour's chosen licence, currently
that licence is the
<a href="harbour15.html#GPL">GPL</a> and/or the GPL with
<a href="harbour17.html#HarbourException">Harbour exception</a>.</p>
<p>Note, however, that some files that are part of harbour have been placed in
the public domain.</p>
