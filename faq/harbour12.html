  <h2><a id="12"></a>2.6. How did Harbour get started?</h2>
<p>The idea of a
<a href="harbour13.html#FreeSoftware">free software</a> Clipper compiler
has been floating around for a long time and the subject has often cropped
up in discussion on <a href="news:comp.lang.clipper">comp.lang.clipper</a>. Actual work to get something developed started
early in 1999 when Antonio Linares <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.lang.clipper/D6_Q5GUKae8/T1AG-P2WSVsJ">started a thread</a> to
discuss some ideas about developing a Clipper grammar using Lex and Yacc.</p>
<p>The rest, as they say, is history (that history might form the basis of
another document should I ever get the time to compile it).</p>
