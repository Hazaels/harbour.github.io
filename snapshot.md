# Nightly Builds

You can find the latest development sources for Harbour directly on our website.
Source code is checked out of version repository and packaged every night and
made available along with the binaries compiled for Linux.

These packages are _not_ intended for production use; please use the packages
at the download page.

If you do encounter a bug, please test the latest snapshot build to see if it
has already been fixed by a developer.

the source repository.
