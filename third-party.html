  Object-Oriented Harbour Graphical interface. This is an object-oriented style conversion from the MiniGUI's library. Supporting
  existing code, and adding new and powerful advantages of the object oriented programming.<br>
  <br>
  It offers a great flexibility for the well-know MiniGUI functionality, and a very easy way to add new features with the lesser
  affectation to working code (anyone can subclass any control and add it's own features to it).

  Is a cross-platform GUI library for Harbour, it is written on C and Harbour.<br>
  <br>
  HwGUI includes two versions: Windows and Linux. Windows version is based on direct calls of win32 API &mdash; this allows to keep it quite
  fast and compact. Linux version is based on GTK, it supports the same set of classes, commands and functions as the Windows
  version, though not all yet. Thus, using some base subset of HwGUI, you can create crossplatform GUI applications.<br>
  <br>
  Currently Windows version of HwGUI supports 5 C compilers: Mingw, MS Visual C, Borland C, Pelles C and Open Watcom C.

  wxHarbour is a set of Harbour language bindings for wxWidgets. Providing a portable multi-platform GUI toolkit for Harbour.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="read_more">Note: wxWidgets lets developers create applications for Windows, macOS, GTK+, X11, Motif, and more
  using one codebase. It can be used from languages such as C++, Python, Perl, Harbour and C#/.NET. Unlike other cross-platform
  toolkits, wxWidgets applications look and feel native. This is because wxWidgets uses the platform's own native controls
  rather than emulating them. It's also extensive, free, open-source, and mature.</span><br>

  <img class="img_right" src="images/3rd_wxwidgets.svg" alt="logo">
  HbWxW is a multiplatform GUI library for Harbour. It is built on top of wxWidgets platform GUI library, available on Unix like
  systems, Windows, macOS operating systems. wxWidgets is "An open source C++ GUI framework to make cross-platform
  programming child's play".<br>
  <br>
  The main goal of HbWxW is to provide an easy to use GUI library, which can be utilized on all platforms Harbour currently
  supports. That's why it is based on a library which gives you a single, easy-to-use API for writing GUI applications on multiple
  platforms.<br>
  <br>
  HbWxW, like its underlying GUI library, is powerfull and efficient enough to realize the most common tasks, as expected by the
  average and advanced programmers. Its main advantage over other GUI libraries is the 'native look &amp; feel' on all supported
  platforms, simplyfying application usage and giving users the same sense of comfort they are already used to.

  FiveWin is original a library for Clipper 5 which you use in exactly the same way that you have been using
  other third party libraries in Clipper. The main difference is that FiveWin lets you build executables that run on
  Windows as REAL Windows Programs.<br>
  <br>
  You have all the power of Windows and it's environment at your fingertips! Only downside of the FiveWin for Clipper&hellip; it's still
  16-bit. Now FiveTech Software has managed to make the library work with Harbour.
