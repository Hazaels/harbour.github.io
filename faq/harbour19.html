  <h2><a id="19"></a>2.13. Will my applications be affected by the GPL?</h2>
<p>No, the
<a href="harbour17.html#HarbourException">Harbour exception</a> seeks to ensure
that, when you build an application with Harbour, compiling with the Harbour
compiler and linking against the HVM and RTL, your rights to licence your
own code are not in any way affected.</p>
<p>Harbour's licence is there to try and protect the freedom offered by the
Harbour developers. Harbour's licence isn't there to try and force you to
choose a specific licence.</p>
<p>Be assured that it isn't the intention of the
<a href="harbour9.html#WhoDevelopers">Harbour developers</a> that your applications will have to be released
as <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>. Supporting free software would be the right thing to do but the
Harbour developers have decided not to insist on this; we think it is more
useful in this situation to set up Harbour's license so that it does not
make any conditions on the status of your work that was built with and
against Harbour.</p>
<p>As always, don't take anyone else's word for this stuff, when in doubt, read
the licence. If you're still in doubt pay someone who knows what they are
doing to read the licence for you. Hopefully you do this with licences for
your other development tools, Harbour is no different, it has a licence that
you need to understand.</p>
