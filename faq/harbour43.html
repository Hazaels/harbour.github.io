  <h2><a name="43"></a>5.1. Where can I get pre-built binaries?</h2>
<p>While Harbour is still in development the preferred method of getting a
Harbour binary is to download the source and build it yourself because this
aids the development effort.</p>
<p>However, the
<a href="harbour9.html#WhoDevelopers">Harbour developers</a> also
appreciate the efforts of people who don't want to develop Harbour itself
but do want to test it and report bugs. To this end some people maintain
Harbour binaries that are ready to be installed.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that the following may not be the very latest cut of
Harbour (Harbour changes by the hour while in this early phase of
development) and that some platforms might be better supported than others.
If you see that a platform isn't supported or is out of date please consider
stepping in and making available binaries for that platform.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=681">downloads page</a>
on the <a href="/">Harbour project's web site</a>
contains a number of binary builds of the latest stable snapshot.

</li>
<li><a href="mailto:dholm@jsd-llc.com">David G. Holm</a> is
maintaing a repository of binary builds of stable (and sometimes, in
parallel, unstable) releases at <a href="http://harbour.netfang.net/">http://harbour.netfang.net/</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If you can't find binaries for your environment via the above links then
this means that someone isn't contributing for that environment, perhaps
you'd care to step in and fill that gap?</p>
