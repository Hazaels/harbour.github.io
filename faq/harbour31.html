  <h2><a id="31"></a>3.11. I can't code C, how can I help development? </h2>
<p>How about doing some Clipper (the language) coding? Parts of Harbour have
been and can be written in itself. Why not look at
<a href="harbour27.html#WhatToDo">what needs doing</a> in the run-time library and seeing what could be
coded using normal Clipper code?</p>
<p>Don't worry about speed for the moment, chances are the functions you're
thinking about are not speed critical, even if they are someone can come
along and, using your implementation as the base design, re-code it in C for
extra speed (if re-coding will speed it up).</p>
