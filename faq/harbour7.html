  <h2><a id="7"></a>2.1. What is Harbour?<a id="WhatIsHarbour"></a></h2>
<p>Harbour is a
<a href="harbour13.html#FreeSoftware">free software</a> compiler for the
xBase superset language often referred to as Clipper (the language that is
implemented by the compiler
<a href="harbour5.html#Trademarks">CA-Clipper</a>).
Harbour's chosen base implementation is, for the moment, the 5.2e version of
<a href="harbour5.html#Trademarks">CA-Clipper</a>. This isn't to say that the
additions found in 5.3 won't make it into Harbour, it simply reflects the
fact that many Clipper programmers see 5.2e as the &quot;last best&quot;
implementation of Clipper.</p>
<p>If the 5.3 extensions to the language are important to you please feel free
to
<a href="harbour45.html#WhenFinished">contribute to the project</a>.</p>
