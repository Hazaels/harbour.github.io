  <h2><a name="49"></a>6.5. Will Harbour support existing CA-Clipper 3rd party products?</h2>
<p>No, but the above is the wrong question to ask. The question to ask is
&quot;will existing
<a href="harbour5.html#Trademarks">CA-Clipper</a> 3rd party
products support Harbour?&quot;, that's a question you should ask of the
product author.</p>
<p>See the <a href="/">Harbour web site</a>
for details of which 3rd party product authors are currently developing for
Harbour or intend to support Harbour in the near future.</p>
