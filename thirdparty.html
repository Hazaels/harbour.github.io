<h2><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hwgui/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HwGUI</a></h2>
<div>
  <span class="third-logo"><i class="fa fa-desktop" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>
  Is a cross-platform GUI library for Harbour, it is written in C and Harbour.<br>
  <br>
  HwGUI includes two versions: Windows and Linux. Windows version is based on direct calls of win32 API — this allows to keep it quite
  fast and compact. Linux version is based on GTK, it supports the same set of classes, commands and functions as the Windows
  version, though not all yet. Thus, using some base subset of HwGUI, you can create crossplatform GUI applications.<br>
  <br>
  Currently Windows version of HwGUI supports 5 C compilers: Mingw, MS Visual C, Borland C, Pelles C and Open Watcom C.

  Harbour MiniGUI (HMG) is an xBase Windows / GUI Development System based on Harbour MiniGUI library, Harbour
  MiniGUI IDE, Harbour compiler and MinGW compiler. This implements a semi-OOP model and is a ready to use Harbour
  distribution who include all needed components for your work.<br>

  <img class="img-right" src="images/3rd_oohg.jpg" alt="logo">
  Object-Oriented Harbour Graphical interface. This is an object-oriented style conversion from the MiniGUI's library. Supporting
  existing code, and adding new and powerful advantages of the object oriented programming.<br>
  <br>
  It offers a great flexibility for the well-know MiniGUI functionality, and a very easy way to add new features with the lesser
  affectation to working code (anyone can subclass any control and add its own features to it).

<h2><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxharbour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wxHarbour</a></h2>
<div>
  <img class="img-right" src="images/3rd_wxwidgets.svg" alt="logo">
  wxHarbour is a set of Harbour language bindings for wxWidgets. Providing a portable multi-platform GUI toolkit for Harbour.<br>
  <br>
  wxWidgets lets developers create applications for Windows, macOS, GTK+, X11, Motif, and more
  using one codebase. Unlike other cross-platform toolkits, wxWidgets applications look and feel
  native. This is because wxWidgets uses the platform's own native controls rather than emulating
  them. It's also extensive, free, open-source, and mature.
</div>

<h2><a href="http://harbour.fm.interia.pl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HBwxW</a></h2>
<div>
  HBwxW is a multiplatform GUI library for Harbour. It is built on top of wxWidgets platform GUI library, available on Unix like
  systems, Windows, macOS operating systems. wxWidgets is "An open source C++ GUI framework to make cross-platform
  programming child's play".<br>
  <br>
  The main goal of HBwxW is to provide an easy to use GUI library, which can be utilized on all platforms Harbour currently
  supports. That's why it is based on a library which gives you a single, easy-to-use API for writing GUI applications on multiple
  platforms.<br>
  <br>
  HBwxW, like its underlying GUI library, is powerful and efficient enough to realize the most common tasks, as expected by the
  average and advanced programmers. Its main advantage over other GUI libraries is the 'native look &amp; feel' on all supported
  platforms, simplyfying application usage and giving users the same sense of comfort they are already used to.

<div>
  <img class="img-right" src="images/3rd_gtk.svg" height="48" alt="logo">
  xbGTK is an open source library for Linux and Windows. It allows to use GTK+ in programs written in xBase-like languages. The
  library is written by Phil Krylov. It is based on the PyGTK — Project by James Henstridge. Some files are modified, though, to
  generate proper xBase code (instead of Python).

<h2><a href="http://xhgtk.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xHGtk</a></h2>
<div>
  xHGtk is an multiplataform GUI library for Harbour. Use GTK+ to create programs that can run in Windows and Linux. It provides a
  library of commands, functions and classes for multiplatform development using Harbour, MinGW graphics library and GTK + 2.10 or
  higher.

<h2><a href="http://www.fivetechsoft.com/english/fwh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveWin for Harbour (FWH)</a></h2>
<div>
  <img class="img-right" src="images/3rd_fw.jpg" alt="logo">
  FiveWin was originally a library for Clipper 5 which you use in exactly the same way that you have been using
  other third party libraries in Clipper. The main difference is that FiveWin lets you build executables that run
  as REAL Windows GUI Programs.<br>
  <br>
  You have all the power of Windows and its environment at your fingertips! Only downside of the FiveWin for Clipper… it's still
  16-bit. Now FiveTech Software has managed to make the library work with Harbour.
